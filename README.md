# Shifu SDK

**Simplify IoT device management and monitoring**

Shifu SDK is a collection of software development kits for **Shifu**, an open-source Kubernetes-native IoT gateway that creates digital twins of your physical devices. Each digital twin, called a **deviceShifu**, represents and manages a physical device in software, abstracting away protocol differences and connectivity complexities. Whether you're building smart sensors, industrial equipment monitors, or connected device applications, Shifu SDK helps you interact with deviceShifu digital twins, letting you focus on your business logic while the Shifu gateway handles device lifecycle management.

## What Can You Do with Shifu SDK?

Shifu SDK provides a straightforward way to:

- **Create and Manage deviceShifu** - Instantiate digital representations of your physical devices in the Shifu IoT gateway with minimal setup
- **Monitor Device Health** - Keep track of device status and respond to issues automatically with built-in health checking
- **Configure Devices** - Load and manage device configurations seamlessly through Kubernetes ConfigMaps

## Why Use Shifu SDK?

### Simple to Use
Get started quickly with intuitive APIs that don't require deep infrastructure knowledge. Write device management code that feels natural in your preferred programming language.

### Reliable Monitoring
Built-in health checking ensures your devices are always monitored, with automatic status updates and failure detection.

### Cloud-Native Ready
Designed to work seamlessly with modern cloud infrastructure, making deployment and scaling straightforward.

### Flexible Architecture
Works with various device types, protocols, and deployment scenarios - from single devices to large-scale IoT deployments.

## Available SDKs

Shifu SDK is available in multiple programming languages to fit your development environment:
